## How to Set Up GitHub Actions for Automated MkDocs Deployment

### Preparing Your MkDocs Project for GitHub Actions

To automate the deployment of your MkDocs project using GitHub Actions, you'll need to set up a specific directory structure and configuration files within your repository. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

1. **Create your GitHub repository:**  
   If you haven't already, create a new repository on GitHub to host your MkDocs project.

2. **Create the `.github` Directory:**
   - Navigate to the root of your MkDocs project and create a new folder named `.github`. This directory will house the GitHub Actions workflows and other GitHub-specific configurations.

3. **Add a `workflows` Directory:**
   - Inside the `.github` folder, create another folder named `workflows`. This is where all workflow configuration files will be stored.

4. **Create the CI Workflow File:**
    * Within the `workflows` folder, create a file named `ci.yml`. This YAML file will define the Continuous Integration (CI) workflow that GitHub Actions will execute.

5. **Configure the CI Workflow:**
    * Open the `ci.yml` file and add the necessary steps to install MkDocs, build the site, and deploy it to GitHub Pages. See Example CI Workflow Configuration below.

6. **Commit and Push Changes:**
    * Once you've set up the CI workflow, commit the changes to your repository and push them to GitHub. This will trigger the CI workflow and deploy your MkDocs site.

7. **Monitor the Workflow:**
    * After pushing the changes, navigate to the "Actions" tab on your GitHub repository to monitor the progress of the CI workflow. You should see the workflow running and deploying your MkDocs site.

8. **Access Your Deployed Site:**
    * Once the workflow has completed successfully, you can access your deployed MkDocs site by visiting the GitHub Pages URL associated with your repository. To do this, open the "Settings" tab of your repository, scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section, and find the URL under "Your site is published at."

9. **Add Deployed Site Link to Repository Details:**
    * To make it easier for visitors to access your deployed MkDocs site, consider adding the GitHub Pages URL to the repository details or the README file. To add the URL to the Repository Details, search for the "About" section on the right side of your repository page and click the gear icon to edit the details. You can then add the GitHub Pages URL under "Website."

### Example CI Workflow Configuration

Below is an example of a `ci.yml` file that sets up a CI workflow for deploying an MkDocs site. This configuration ensures that every push to the `master` or `main` branches triggers the deployment process.

```yaml
name: ci 
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master 
      - main
permissions:
  contents: write
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Configure Git Credentials
        run: |
          git config user.name github-actions[bot]
          git config user.email 41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: 3.x
      - run: echo "cache_id=$(date --utc '+%V')" >> $GITHUB_ENV 
      - uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          key: mkdocs-material-${{ env.cache_id }}
          path: .cache
          restore-keys: |
            mkdocs-material-
      - run: pip install mkdocs-material 
      - run: mkdocs gh-deploy --force
```

### Deployment Steps Explained

- **Checkout the Repository:** Initializes the repository content on the runner, allowing further actions to manipulate the project files.
- **Configure Git Credentials:** Sets up Git with credentials used by GitHub Actions, which allows it to commit back to your repository.
- **Setup Python Environment:** Prepares the Python environment with the specified version, ensuring compatibility with MkDocs.
- **Generate Cache ID:** Creates a unique identifier for caching dependencies, which speeds up subsequent workflow runs.
- **Cache Dependencies:** Caches Python dependencies to reduce build time.
- **Install MkDocs Material:** Installs the MkDocs Material theme and other required Python packages.
- **Deploy to GitHub Pages:** Builds and deploys your MkDocs site to GitHub Pages using a force push to overwrite existing content.

To change the header color using **MkDocs Material** without custom CSS, you can leverage the built-in `palette` feature in the `mkdocs.yml` configuration file. This method allows you to set primary and accent colors for the entire site, including the header.

### Steps to Change Header Color and Theme Using MkDocs Material

* **Open Your `mkdocs.yml` Configuration File:**
    - In your MkDocs project folder, locate and open the `mkdocs.yml` file.

* **Set the Color Palette:**
    - Under the `theme` section, add or modify the `palette` configuration to specify your desired primary and accent colors. For example:

```yaml
theme:
  name: 'material'
  palette:
    scheme: default
    primary: 'blue'
    accent: 'amber'
```


   - **Primary Color**: Sets the main color theme for your header and other primary elements.
   - **Accent Color**: Sets the accent color for links, buttons, and interactive elements.
   - Replace `'blue'` and `'amber'` with the colors that best suit your style. MkDocs Material supports a variety of colors, such as `'red'`, `'green'`, `'purple'`, `'indigo'`, `'teal'`, etc.

* **Available Color Schemes:**
    - MkDocs Material offers several built-in color schemes you can choose from. Each scheme changes the background, text contrast, and tone for the entire site, including the header and sidebar. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each scheme:
   
     - **`default`**: The standard light scheme, with a white background and dark text. It provides a clean and bright look, ideal for general readability.
     - **`slate`**: A subtle, slightly darker scheme than `default`, featuring a muted background and softer contrast. This scheme is a great choice for a more subdued appearance while still remaining light.
     - **`dark`**: A full dark mode theme with a dark background and light text, suitable for users who prefer a low-light setting. This scheme is especially useful for nighttime reading.
     - **`black`**: The darkest scheme available, with a true black background and high-contrast light text. Itâ€™s designed to offer the most contrast and is perfect for OLED screens or users seeking maximum readability in dark mode.

4. **Preview Your Changes:**
      - Run the following command to preview the changes locally:

      ```bash
      mkdocs serve
      ```

      - This command starts a local development server where you can view the updated header color and palette changes.

5. **Deploy Your Site:**
    - Once youâ€™re satisfied with the color scheme, deploy your MkDocs site to apply the changes to your live documentation.

## How to Add Weekly Assignments and Any Other Materials in General

### Adding Weekly Assignments

* **Create a New Markdown File**:  
   In the `docs/assignments` directory, create a new markdown file named in the format `W00-01.md`, where `W00` represents the week number and `01` is the assignment number.
   Example: `W00-01.md` is the first assignment for week 0.

   **Folder Structure:**

```txt
  docs/
    assignments/
      W00-01.md
      W00-02.md
      ...
```

* **Add Front Matter**:  
   At the beginning of each markdown file, include the following front matter:

```yaml
  ---
  layout: "assignment"
  title:  "Week 00 - Assignment 01"
  hide:
    - navigation
    - toc
  ---
```

* **Add Assignment Content**:  
   After the front matter, add the details of the assignment.

   **Example:**

```markdown
  ---
  layout: "assignment"
  title:  "Week 00 - Assignment 01"
  hide:
    - navigation
    - toc
  ---

  ## Week 00 - Assignment 01
  Please complete the following tasks:
  1. Task 1
  2. Task 2
```

### Adding Other Materials

* **Create a Materials Folder**:  
   In the `docs` directory, create a folder named `materials` and add any relevant files (e.g., `slides.pdf`, `notes.md`).
   
   **Folder Structure:**

```txt
  docs/
    materials/
      slides.pdf
      notes.md
      ...
```

### Linking One Page to Another

To create links between pages, use the following markdown syntax:

```markdown
  [Link Text](path/to/page.md)
```

> **Note**: Do not include `docs` in the path, as it may prevent the link from working.

**Example**: To link from `W00-01.md` to a material called `Memory` in the `docs/materials` folder:

```markdown
  ---
  layout: "assignment"
  title:  "Week 00 - Assignment 01"
  hide:
    - navigation
    - toc
  ---

  ## Week 00 - Assignment 01
  Please complete the following tasks:
  1. Task 1
  2. Task 2

  Materials:
  - [Memory](materials/memory.md)
```
