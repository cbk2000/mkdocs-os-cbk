# OS Week 00 Assignment #3: Create Your GitHub Page

- Do GSGS (Google Here, There, and Everywhere)
    - See also [https://doit.vlsm.org/031.html](https://doit.vlsm.org/031.html).
- Find out how to create your GitHub Page! E.g. “cbkadal” (Cicak Bin Kadal).
    - The GitHub repository will be
    [https://github.com/cbkadal/os242/](https://github.com/cbkadal/os242/).
    - The GitHub Page will be
    [https://cbkadal.github.io/os242/](https://cbkadal.github.io/os242/).

- **Keep your GitHub Page simple!**
    - Your repo size should be less than 1 M bytes.
    - Do not apply any Jekyll theme.
    - Any image size should be less than 50 Kbytes.
    - No external CSS and fonts.
    - Google Analytics is allowed.
    - Avoid Too Much Information! Do not disclose anything you do not want to tell
    (e.g., your name, student ID, address, etc.) !!
- **But always REMEMBER**, you are not **cbkadal**!
  Always replace “cbkadal” with your **own** GitHub account.
