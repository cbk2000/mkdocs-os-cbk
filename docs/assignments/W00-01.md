# OS Week 00 Assignment #1: GitHub Account and Repository

This is neither a programming nor a web course. However, assignments will be submitted to GitHub and displayed on GitHub Page.

## SIGN UP (or SIGN IN)

- **SIGN UP** if you do not have a GitHub.com account.
    - More details at [https://doit.vlsm.org/029.html](https://doit.vlsm.org/029.html)
    - Preferably, use all lowercase characters for your GitHub account.
    - Linux accounts are **case-sensitive**. Fortunately, GitHub accounts are not.
- Else, **SIGN IN** at [GitHub.com](https://github.com/)


## Create a new Repository (os242)

- Create GitHub repository “**os242**”. For “os,” use lowercase (do not use uppercase)!
  See also cbkadal at [https://github.com/cbkadal/os242/](https://github.com/cbkadal/os242/).
    - **But always REMEMBER**, you are not **cbkadal**!
    - Always replace **cbkadal** with your **own** GitHub account.
- The repository naming is:
    - “os242” for the year 2024-2 (odd semester 2024/2025),
    - “os251” for the year 2025-1 (even semester 2024/2025),
    - “os252” for the year 2025-2 (odd semester 2025/2026),
    - “os261” for the year 2026-1 (even semester 2025/2026),
    - “os262” for the year 2026-2 (odd semester 2026/2027),
    - etc.
- Visit [https://doit.vlsm.org/030.html](https://doit.vlsm.org/030.html) for an example of creating the os232 repository.


## Default Branch: **main** or **master**?

- More details at [https://doit.vlsm.org/030.html#idx07](https://doit.vlsm.org/030.html#idx07)
- The current GitHub DEFAULT Branch is “main.”
    - In the past, the default branch was “master.”
    - To be “politically correct,” GitHub has changed the default branch name from ”master” to ”main.”
    - Many past examples here have been using the “master” branch name.
    - Therefore – to be consistent – the “master” branch name will continue to be used.
    - Feel free to use either “main” or “master.” However, DO NOT alter your branch name once it has been chosen.
    - To change the default branch name, click “settings.”
